# Setup

- Create a folder named ``.macrodroid`` with a file called ``patch_history`` in the home directory of your Android device.
- Install MacroDroid from the Play Store (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arlosoft.macrodroid).
- Import the file ``Patch_logger.macro`` into MacroDroid.
- **ATTENTION:** In order for MacroDroid to to access the folder ``.macrodroid`` it requires the respective permission, which is not granted by importing or running the macro. In order to grant this permission, simply try to export this (or any other macro) into the ``.macrodroid`` folder. This will trigger the permission dialog to appear, which can then be accepted.
